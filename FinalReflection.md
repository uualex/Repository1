The shipping and logistics industry have used data analytics in its elementary forms for the of longest time. With the aim of profit maximization these shipping companies have transitioned into the world of big data and measure metrics from supply, fuel, communication, routing, shipping time, freight rates, overhead, navigation, weather, fleet coordination, and inventory.

Predictive features can be used to mitigate losses and optimize shipping. Causes of lost vessels at sea, lost warehouse containers, and damaged goods can be prevented through the data collected from sensors for temperature, volume, and others. 

The methods of data entry has also been improved. One example, Shipamax, integrates emails receipts and attachments and automatically entry shipping data. By using artificial intelligence and computer vision, Shipamax is able to cut down costs, paperwork, data security, efficiency, and time compared to manually inputting and reading email receipts. 

Another shipping related company, ClearMetal, uses their software to predict risks and potential delays throughout the entire shipping process. Their software utilizes machine learning for logistics planning. 

A third interesting application is the usage of wave data. An MIT research team labeled a new type of wave data that is used to predict rouge waves formations. These rouge waves are especially costly to the maritime shipping industry with the delays and damages the are associated with poor sea weather. Because of this discovery, companies have been quick to capitalize on wave data to better insure and protect and safety of crew and cargo. These predictive algorithms for shipping routing and weather use many core data science concepts such as machine learning and 

These applications benefit both the consumers and producers with faster and more reliable shipping as well as cost mitigation and improved asset utilization for the shipping providers.
