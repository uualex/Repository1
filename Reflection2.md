Currently, the estimated reliability of the 7-day weather forecast is near 80% certain. This accuracy for short-term weather predicting is suitable for selecting an appropriate clothing outfit to making weekend plans. However, by extending this day range to even 15 days, experts and researchers claim that weather prediction holds almost no value and at best are generalization potential precipitation. With traditional, supercomputer and physic-equation-based models, it is believed by Penn State researchers that the 15-day forecast is the upper limit. 

However, in the last decade, and much more recently, the addition of machine learning and other data science principles have surpassed previous estimates to forecasting ability. Even by humbling extending a forecast range by 2 days, increases in natural disaster preparation can save both money and lives. 

With the vast amount of weather data available from satellites, planes, radar, ground measurements, balloons, and even mobile phones the application of machine learning and forecasting was inevitable. In combination with the size of earth and current highly intensive supercomputer models, the leap to a machine learning model makes sense. Even with a limited spatial resolution of 5km these models are limited by computational resources to process the data. In addition, current weather models are completed in 6 hour runs limiting the models to make only 3-4 runs a day. 

Instead of using 6+ hour old forecast models, machine learning based models like Nowcast are unique in their fast conclusions. A main component of nowcast is radar prediction. This is especially useful in regions of the world were radar stations are limited and when satellite coverage is unavailable. Nowcast predicts radar from images (radar charts) and uses convolutional neural networks.  By reading the advection of cloud motion and convection for cloud formations these data-driven models are able to identify weather patterns and nuances that physics has not discovered. Neural networks process this data in a way that avoids computer intensive physics-based equations. This method is more efficient in computer usage and time that makes increasingly accurate minute to minute predictions.

Another current application of machine-learning is 4D-Var. It is a “weak-constraint” algorithm that helps current physics models correct and identify bias and adjust final forecast accordingly. This method is used to apply the precision of ML models but account for its weakness in 10+ day predictions. 

Some of the current barriers of machine learning forecasting models are its reliance on 2D images analysis (compared to 3D analysis). However, if these data-driven models can incorporate data that does not depend on 2D convolutional networks potential forecasts will surpass the dubious current 15-day forecast.
