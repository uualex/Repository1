The method of consuming music has changed from live, CDs, portable music players, and now music streaming. With the rise of social media and prominent music streaming sites like Spotify and Apple Music data from streaming music is now abundant, organized, and accessible. Big music companies and small individual artists can apply this data to aid their reach to listeners and cater songs to their preferences. 

Companies like Spotify already use data analytics to recommend playlists and artists based on listener’s data. However, data science is increasingly being used in music creation. Using social media, listener’s feedback, and other metrics, the music industry is able to detect trends and predict hype. In conjunction with timing concert dates, music-video release dates, and artist feature selections data science has been great with profit maximization. 

Hit songs are becoming less about raw talent and more about data from genre, lyrics, timing. This could explain the rise in smaller, lesser-known, artists rise to fame who happen to hit these data points perfectly. 

Deep learning is also being used to aid song creativity and beat creation. A google research team, developed a deep learning algorithm, NSynth super, that creates organic sounds with real instrument audio. Its neural network is based from current popular mixes and samples of music and beats. NSynth main learning and processing components revolve around a Temporal Encoder and WaveNet Decoder. As music deep learning improves, algorithms like NSynth may be aids for musician’s block as an source of inspiration in music creation. With its access to a range of 300,000 possible notes and ~1000 music instrument sounds unique machine created music will become the future of the music industry.
