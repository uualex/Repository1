A google-owned company, Deepmind, created a single system that could self-teach itself from scratch the games of chess, shogi, and Go. Without any prior game knowledge besides basic rules, the system, AlphaZero, was able to master its respective game through solely machine learning. Unlike its counterparts, AlphaZero does not utilize brute force calculations and heuristics for traditional strategy. Instead, AlphaZero uses a method of Data Science called neural networks and the Monte-Carlo Tree Search for its machine learning. 

AlphaZero learns and develops its neural network through simulating games against itself. Over time, it keeps winning tendencies and removes losing ones. Through its constant adaptations, the system can improve incrementally as it updates the versions of itself.  

Through millions of simulated games and reinforcement learning, AlphaZero progresses from arbitrary game moves to game knowledge that far surpasses the games world champions. With volume, this trial and error style of learning developed its organic and dynamic playstyle that is immune to human biases and reliance on rigid “best” strategies. Former chess world champion, Garry Kasprov, describes it as dynamic and human-like in its play style. Additionally, with its self-created neural network, AlphaZero implements a Monte-Carlo Tree Search to identify the best move most efficiently. The chess variation of AlphaZero is able to determine a move in a fraction of the calculations and time in comparison to its predecessors that use brute force calculations in. 

AlphaZero is also utilizes Cloud Tensor Processing Unit (TPUs) that were designed specifically for machine learning.  These TPUs have a comparative advantage over other processing units in the way it innovates quantization, inference math, parallel processing, systolic arrays, and more. In conjunction with traditionally available CPUs, these TPUs are ideal for the AlphaZero project and other machine learning concepts. 

The result of data science and machine learning has led human-kind as close as possible to “solving” games like chess, shogi, and go. While AlphaZero is not currently available to the public, similar neural network-based game engines are used as great learning tools for the world’s top chess, shogi, and go players. Unlike before, there is a solution to the lack of top .1% player’s minds. AlphaZero has immensely increased the ability for everyone to study and practice games at the highest level.
